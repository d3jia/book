- Video Title: `Strange Experiences Of Consciousness That I Have No Scientific Explanation Or Proof For But Thats OK` by Goobie and Doobie
- Summary: The speaker, a former neurosurgeon with extensive neuroscience and cognitive science training (including studies at MIT), shares **deeply personal and unconventional experiences related to consciousness** over the past few years. Despite a strong scientific background, the speaker highlights the **limitations of science in fully explaining consciousness**, primarily because consciousness is unique, non-repeatable, and self-referential—science requires repeatability and objective observation.

### Key Themes and Insights

- **Consciousness and Science**  
  - Consciousness is difficult to study scientifically because every moment is unique and consciousness itself is the tool used for its own study.  
  - Many aspects of consciousness elude current scientific frameworks, especially materialism.

- **Personal Journey and Self-Love**  
  - The speaker has spent over a year focused on healing, self-understanding, and learning to love themselves—a process that took decades.  
  - **Love is defined as an action**: wishing well-being for oneself and others, not merely a feeling.

- **Dreams and Shared Dream Experiences**  
  - The speaker recounts **shared dreams with others** (e.g., a hiking companion), raising questions about collective or interconnected consciousness.  
  - A prophetic childhood dream predicted the birth and name of the speaker’s biological brother, illustrating unexplained precognitive elements in consciousness.  
  - Other vivid dreams included surreal visions of alternate dimensions, symbolic animals (like a burnt rabbit tied to a Buddhist story), and messages about self-sacrifice and self-love.

- **Intuition and “Glowing Guide”**  
  - Described as gut feelings or inner nudges that guide decisions.  
  - The speaker notes multiple instances where listening to intuition helped avoid harm or bad outcomes, especially in medical practice.

- **Visions and Non-Physical Encounters**  
  - Experiences of seeing a cryptic smiling man in a vision while awake, and later recognizing the same location in real life.  
  - Other visions involved symbolic imagery like a black hole representing emotional darkness associated with difficult people.  
  - These occurrences are deeply subjective and not externally verifiable.

- **Unusual Animal Encounters and Synchronicity**  
  - The speaker describes a profound emotional connection with ducks during moments of personal crisis and decision-making.  
  - Ducks appeared repeatedly as symbolic signs, seemingly encouraging him to make life changes such as quitting a demanding surgical career.  
  - Later encounters included finding a severed duck head, adding to the mystery.  
  - Other animals (deer, rabbits) also exhibited unusual behavior, as if acknowledging or supporting the speaker.

- **Remote Viewing and Psychic Phenomena**  
  - Inspired by the TV show *Stranger Things* and historical government projects, the speaker tried sensory deprivation tank remote viewing.  
  - Successfully visualized a colleague’s front door with detailed accuracy, though encountered a disturbing “eye” sensation and ceased attempts due to privacy concerns.  
  - Also used remote viewing to locate a lost object in storage boxes.  
  - Attempts to leverage this ability for lottery success failed.

- **Interpersonal Phenomena and Rock-Paper-Scissors Anomaly**  
  - The speaker and wife experienced an unusual pattern where the wife almost always won in rock-paper-scissors, far beyond statistical probability.  
  - By consciously trying to choose the opposite of expected choices, the speaker began winning consistently, suggesting unconscious telepathic connections or shared consciousness.  
  - They switched back to coin flips for fairness due to this anomaly.

- **Encounters with a Shadowy Presence on a Trail**  
  - During a long mountain hike, the speaker perceived a dark, triangular-headed shadow figure blocking the trail, causing fear and physical reaction.  
  - On a subsequent visit, offering a strawberry and speaking calmly caused a sensation of a dark hand touching the speaker’s hand, with no visible presence.  
  - The nature of this entity remains *uncertain* but it was not overtly hostile.

- **Effects of Substances on Consciousness**  
  - Marijuana (weed gummies) reduces dreaming and disconnects from time and universe perception.  
  - The speaker stopped using weed gummies and alcohol for better connection and mental clarity.  
  - Mushroom gummies enhance connection to the universe and facilitate receiving intuitive answers.

- **Philosophical Reflection on Consciousness and Unity**  
  - The speaker believes **consciousness is fundamental and pervades everything**—living beings, inanimate objects, even vacuum inside a light bulb.  
  - This implies a unified reality where separateness is an illusion and all beings are interconnected through shared consciousness.  
  - This worldview supports the plausibility of phenomena such as telepathy, remote viewing, and collective dreams.  
  - The speaker acknowledges these ideas are not scientifically provable, but insists on their experiential truth.
