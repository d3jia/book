### Causes of the Current Market Conditions

- **Pandemic Overhiring:**  
  Massive hiring surge during 2020-2021 as companies and universities responded to a perceived permanent digital-first world. Amazon, Meta, and Google significantly increased engineering headcounts, leading to oversupply.

- **AI Impact on Hiring Economics:**  
  AI tools automate routine coding tasks, reducing the need for junior developers. Despite perceived productivity gains, studies show experienced developers using AI are actually slower, yet companies expect all engineers to be AI-proficient and prefer hiring experienced talent over juniors to avoid training costs.

- **Global Talent Competition:**  
  Remote work adoption enabled companies to hire skilled engineers from lower-cost countries (e.g., Argentina, India), reducing local entry-level opportunities in the U.S. due to cost considerations.

### Who Is Most Affected?

- **New Graduates and Entry-Level Candidates:**  
  Face the highest unemployment rates (6.1% for CS grads vs. lower rates in other fields). Entry-level hiring has drastically declined, shrinking the pathway into tech by over two-thirds in just two years.

- **Generalist Roles:**  
  These positions are being cut as companies focus on specialists with deep expertise.

### What’s Actually Working for Job Seekers?

- **Specialize, Don’t Generalize:**  
  Specialists in AI, cloud, cybersecurity, data engineering, and MLOps are highly sought after. AI skills command a 56% wage premium (up from 25% the previous year).

- **Build Proof, Not Just Credentials:**  
  Employers increasingly prioritize skills and portfolios over degrees. Demonstrating real projects on platforms like GitHub and contributing to open source is crucial.

- **Target Non-FANG Companies and Diverse Sectors:**  
  Mid-sized companies, startups, and industries like healthcare, fintech, enterprise software, and banking are actively hiring tech talent but are often overlooked.

- **Leverage Networks Relentlessly:**  
  Personal connections and referrals significantly improve hiring chances. Engaging in meetups, LinkedIn, and open source communities is essential.

- **Learn to Work With AI, Not Against It:**  
  Success depends on using AI tools to augment abilities, focusing on judgment, ambiguity navigation, stakeholder communication, and business context understanding.
